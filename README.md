# YouTubeYoinker

A multi-threaded Youtube Downloader allowing for a virtually arbitrary number of songs to be downloaded at once. Made with Python 3.8 64-Bit.

# Usage:
1. Paste in Youtube Video URLs in songURLs.txt
2. Paste in Youtube Playlist URLs in playlistURLs.txt
3. Optionally, specify a directory you'd like to save your songs to in dir.txt.
4. Run RUN.bat, or execute however you'd like

Note: The progress bar is currently broken as all downloading songs will try to update it at the same time. Rest assured, this does is working
